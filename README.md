Natours is a fictional company that offers Nature Tours. It currently does not have any functionality (such as links, pages, etc), but showcases advanced CSS skills.

* Clip-path to create angled header image
* Hover animation for images
* Pure CSS Flippable Card
* Pure CSS modal
* Pure CSS form and radio buttons
* Pure CSS navigation button and full screen navigation pop-up with animations
* Used `<img srcset=""/>` to set responsive images based on device size
* Used rem units and percentages to limit the amount of media queries for responsiveness
